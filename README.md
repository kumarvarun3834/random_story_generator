# random_story_generator

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started
# problem statement:
“Random Story Generator”
### Concept: User clicks a button to generate a short story.
### Functionality: 
##### Stories are made from arrays of characters, settings, and actions.
##### On each click, combine random elements: e.g., “A wizard in Paris stole a rainbow.”

##### Can add a fun “moral of the story” at the end.

### Moral is like optional,
##### Suppose user click on button then it will show a short story (means 10-20 words sentence with meaning) and those words are already saved in your arrays. for example:
##### Array1 = “tit”
##### array2 = “for”
##### array3 = “tat"
##### combined - tit for tat (that’s just an example, don’t consider this)
